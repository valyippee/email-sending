# email-sending-tasklets

Purpose of this project is to obtain stock prices data through API calls, store it in a database (I used MariaDB), organize the data (using the velocity template), and send it to my email in a tabulated form.

The Spring framework is used to ease the interaction with the database and to send out email using JavaMailSender.
